Project Requirement Document (PRD)
Project: Book Review Service

1. Overview
The Book Review Service is designed to allow users to review books, manage book data, and provide a robust API for frontend and integration purposes. The project will be developed using spec-driven development, ensuring that all features are defined and tested against clear specifications before implementation.

2. Objectives
- Enable users to add, edit, delete, and view book reviews.
- Manage book metadata (title, author, genre, etc.).
- Provide RESTful APIs for all operations.
- Ensure robust authentication and authorization.
- Maintain high code quality and test coverage.
- Follow spec-driven development: all features must have clear specifications and tests before coding.

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Book Management
- Add new books with metadata.
- Edit book details.
- Delete books.
- List/search books.

3.2 Review Management
- Add reviews for books.
- Edit reviews.
- Delete reviews.
- List reviews for a book.
- Aggregate ratings.

3.3 User Management
- User registration and login.
- User roles (admin, reviewer, guest).
- Profile management.

3.4 API
- RESTful endpoints for all operations.
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger).

3.5 Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication.
- Role-based access control.

3.6 Testing
- Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- Test coverage reports.

3.7 Spec Driven Development
- All features must have a written specification (OpenAPI, JSON Schema, etc.).
- Tests must be written against the spec before implementation.
- Code must conform to the spec and pass all tests.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability: Support for growing user base.
- Security: Protect user data and reviews.
- Performance: Fast API responses.
- Maintainability: Clean, modular codebase.
- Documentation: Comprehensive developer and API docs.

5. Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- Frontend: React.js (optional, if UI required)
- DevOps: Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Testing: Jest/Pytest, Supertest, Postman/Newman

6. Deliverables
- Source code (backend, frontend if applicable)
- API specification (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Test suites and coverage reports
- Deployment scripts (Docker, CI/CD)
- Documentation (README, API docs)

7. Spec Driven Development Instructions
- Write API specs before coding (OpenAPI/Swagger).
- Write JSON Schema for data models.
- Write tests based on specs.
- Implement features only after specs and tests are ready.
- Validate implementation against specs and tests.
